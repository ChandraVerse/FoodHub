## 🧩 Tech Stack & What Each Part Does

### Frontend 🖥️

- **React 18**  
  Component‑based UI library for building interactive pages and stateful components.

- **Vite** ⚡  
  Fast dev server and bundler for instant feedback and optimized builds.

- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨  
  Utility‑first CSS for rapid styling with responsive and dark‑mode classes.

- **Framer Motion**  
  Handles the smooth animations on hero sections, cards, and page transitions.

- **React Router**  
  Manages client‑side routing between pages like Home, Login, Signup, Owner Dashboard, etc.

- **Context APIs**  
  - `AuthContext` – stores logged‑in user info (id, role, email) and login/logout helpers.  
  - `ThemeContext` – controls light/dark mode across the app.

- **Lucide Icons**  
  Provides clean, modern icons for form inputs and navigation.

### Backend ⚙️

- **Spring Boot 3**  
  Java framework powering the REST API, controllers, validation, and application startup.

- **MongoDB + Spring Data MongoDB** 🍃  
  - Models: `User`, `Restaurant` (stored as documents).  
  - Repositories: `UserRepository`, `RestaurantRepository` for easy CRUD operations.  
  - Cloud DB: connected via **MongoDB Atlas** using a connection string in `application.properties`.

- **Authentication & Security** 🔒  
  - `AuthController` exposes `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/login`.  
  - Uses **BCryptPasswordEncoder** to hash passwords before saving to MongoDB.  
  - Basic validation with Jakarta Validation annotations (`@Email`, `@NotBlank`, `@Size`).

- **CORS Configuration** 🌐  
  - `WebConfig` globally allows the frontend origin `http://localhost:5173` to call the backend API.  
  - Handles preflight `OPTIONS` requests and allows credentials/methods/headers.

- **Health & Utility Endpoints** ❤️  
  - `HealthController` → `/api/health` to confirm backend status.  
  - `WelcomeController` → `/` with quick links to main routes.  
  - `GlobalErrorController` → `/error` to give friendly messages for unknown paths.

## 🧑‍💻 How To Run The Project Locally

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)  
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node)  
- [Java 17+](https://adoptium.net/) (project currently runs on Java 25 in dev logs)  
- A free [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) cluster (or update the connection string accordingly)

---

### 2. Clone The Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "Multiple Restaurant Site"
```

---

### 3. Configure Backend (Spring Boot + MongoDB Atlas) 🔧

1. Open `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`  
2. Confirm it uses an environment variable for the connection string:

   ```properties
   server.port=8080
   spring.data.mongodb.uri=${MONGODB_URI}
   ```

3. In your local machine, keep your actual MongoDB Atlas URI in a local-only env file (for example `.env.local`, which is already listed in `.gitignore`), and export it when you run the backend:

   ```bash
   # PowerShell (Windows)
   $env:MONGODB_URI = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.your-id.mongodb.net/foodhub?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Backend runs at: `http://localhost:8080` 🚀  

4. In production (on your hosting platform), add an environment variable named `MONGODB_URI` with your Atlas connection string instead of hardcoding it in the repo.

Key backend endpoints:

- `GET /` – basic welcome + links  
- `GET /api/health` – health check  
- `GET /api/restaurants` – restaurant list  
- `POST /api/auth/signup` – user signup  
- `POST /api/auth/login` – user login  

---

### 4. Run Frontend (React + Vite) 🎯

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd "Multiple Restaurant Site/frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:5173`

The app is already configured to talk to the backend at `http://localhost:8080` with CORS enabled, so signup and login should work when both servers are running.

---

## 📜 Frontend Scripts

Inside the `frontend` directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev` – 🚀 Start the development server with hot‑reload.  
- `npm run build` – 📦 Build the app for production into `dist`.  
- `npm run lint` – 🔍 Lint the code to catch common issues.  
- `npm run preview` – 🌐 Preview the production build locally.

## ✅ How Users Benefit

- **Fast discovery** – Quickly browse restaurants and cuisines in a clean, responsive UI.  
- **Smooth experience** – Animations and dark mode make the app feel modern and enjoyable.  
- **Secure accounts** – Passwords are hashed and stored securely in MongoDB Atlas.
